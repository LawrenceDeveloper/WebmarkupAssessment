                </header>
                <article>The Whoop wearable fitness tracker is a great invention of our time. I've worn it myself and I can tell you with certainty that it's really good. You have to subscribe to a service to use it however. And that can get pricey. So expect to trade some shekels for this product. But it definitely is worth the fortune. It really helps with exercising. And it can do so much more than just help with your exercise.

                <article>This innovation solves a unbalanced exercising routine. It shows you whether it's time to rest or to exercise. It can track your vitals like no other wearable. Tracking your exercise is not the only thing this handy dandy gadget can do. It can also help with your sleep cycle to help maintain a good night's rest. It can also softly wake you up using the vibration feature. This means that it makes you feel good in more than one way.

                    It's very simple to use this product. Simply strap the delicate wearable on and it's on. However, you are not done yet, my friend. You still need to download the WHOOP Android or iOS app. If you do not have a Android or iOS phone, you unfortunately can't download the app. Once you have the app installed, begin tracking! Then you can finally experience the greatness of this gadget. You will enjoy it.

                <article>WHOOP is actually used by a lot of people. A person who uses this is the famous and handsome Laurens de Groot, he uses this marvelous invention a lot. A famous NBA player who used it is DeAndre Jordan. Although he was a sussy baka because he hid it under his wristband which is not allowed. Sneaky bastard. Some other people who used it are LeBron James and Tiger Woods.
