                    a protein shaker and a phone charger. This is really handy when exercising at the gym                    
                    because as you probably know, protein shakes are essential for getting ripped. And you need to mix them well otherwise they aren't smooth. 
                    But you also want to charge your phone so you can keep listening to music while exercising, so this combines those two things to make a great product. Buy it now to upgrade your workout.
